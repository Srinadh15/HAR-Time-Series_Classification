 This repository contains a hybrid deep learning model for classifying human activities from inertial sensor data in the WEAR dataset. The model combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and Transformer layers to achieve 85.81% test accuracy.

 ## Dataset
 The dataset used is the **WEAR dataset** for wearable and egocentric activity recognition, containing inertial (accelerometer) data from 22 participants performing 18 outdoor workout activities. The dataset is publicly available at [mariusbock.github.io/wear/](https://mariusbock.github.io/wear/) and hosted on GitHub at [mariusbock/wear](https://github.com/mariusbock/wear). Download the raw inertial data (CSV files `sbj_0.csv` to `sbj_17.csv`) and place them in the `data/wear/raw/inertial/` folder.
 **Note**: The WEAR dataset is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, allowing non-commercial use with attribution.
